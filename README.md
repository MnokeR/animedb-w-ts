- **Top Anime**: Lists top-rated anime based on user preferences.
- **Anime Details**: Provides detailed information about each anime, including synopsis, release date, genres, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript to improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for navigation within the application.
